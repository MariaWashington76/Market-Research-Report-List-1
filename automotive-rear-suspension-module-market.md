<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Rear Suspension Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Suspension Module</li><li>Semi-Dependent Suspension Module</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive rear suspension module market includes two primary types: independent suspension modules and semi-dependent suspension modules. Independent suspension modules allow each wheel to move independently, enhancing ride comfort and handling by minimizing body roll and improving traction. In contrast, semi-dependent suspension modules connect the wheel axles, providing a balance between comfort and cost-effectiveness, typically resulting in effective load distribution but less flexibility. Both types cater to diverse vehicle requirements, impacting performance, driving dynamics, and overall vehicle design.</p></p>
