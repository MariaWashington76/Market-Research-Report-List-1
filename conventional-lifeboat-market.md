<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Conventional Lifeboat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Lifeboat</li><li>Free Fall Lifeboat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The conventional lifeboat market is categorized into two primary types: closed lifeboats and free-fall lifeboats. Closed lifeboats are fully enclosed, designed to protect passengers from environmental elements, and typically have a self-righting feature. They are favored for their safety and comfort in rough seas. On the other hand, free-fall lifeboats launch from a platform, utilizing gravity for rapid deployment into the water, allowing for quick evacuation in emergencies while minimizing exposure to hazardous conditions during descent.</p></p>
