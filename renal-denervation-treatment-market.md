<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renal Denervation Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radiofrequency</li><li>Ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Renal denervation treatment involves two primary approaches: radiofrequency and ultrasound. Radiofrequency renal denervation utilizes thermal energy to disrupt renal nerves, aimed at lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension. This method is well-established and often employs catheter-based techniques. On the other hand, ultrasound renal denervation employs high-intensity focused ultrasound to achieve similar nerve ablation non-invasively. As both methods gain traction in the market, they cater to different patient needs and preferences in hypertension management.</p></p>
