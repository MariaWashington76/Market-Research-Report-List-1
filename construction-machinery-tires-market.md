<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Machinery Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The construction machinery tires market primarily consists of two types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires have a construction where the plies are arranged at a 90-degree angle to the tread, offering enhanced flexibility, improved traction, and better fuel efficiency. They are ideal for high-speed operations and rough terrains. Bias tires, on the other hand, have plies arranged at diagonal angles, providing greater durability and load-bearing capacity, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications and off-road environments.</p></p>
