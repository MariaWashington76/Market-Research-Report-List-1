<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mid-end ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mid-end ICU ventilators are categorized into two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves the use of endotracheal tubes or tracheostomy to deliver breaths directly into the patient's lungs, commonly used for patients requiring extensive respiratory support. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, employs masks or nasal interfaces to aid breathing without the need for intubation, offering a less traumatic option for patients with milder respiratory distress. Both types are essential for managing different levels of respiratory failure in critical care settings.</p></p>
