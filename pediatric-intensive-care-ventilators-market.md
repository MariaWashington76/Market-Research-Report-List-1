<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pediatric Intensive Care Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pediatric Intensive Care Ventilators market is segmented into two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve intubation, providing direct airflow through a tube inserted into the trachea, suitable for severe respiratory conditions. They offer precise control of ventilation settings. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, use masks or nasal prongs to deliver air without invasive procedures. This approach is generally preferred for less critical patients, minimizing discomfort and reducing the risk of complications while supporting breathing.</p></p>
