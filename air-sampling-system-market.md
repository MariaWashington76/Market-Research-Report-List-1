<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Sampling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pipe Detector</li><li>Smoke Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air sampling system market comprises various technologies, primarily pipe detectors and smoke detectors. Pipe detectors use a network of pipes to continuously sample air from an environment, identifying smoke particles and detecting early signs of fire. In contrast, smoke detectors typically rely on local sensing methods to detect smoke concentration within a confined area. Both systems serve critical roles in fire safety, with pipe detectors offering wider area coverage and smoke detectors providing quick response in localized settings.</p></p>
