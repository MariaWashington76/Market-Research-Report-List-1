<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Fusion Stimulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable</li><li>Non-implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal fusion stimulator market is divided into two primary types: implantable and non-implantable. Implantable stimulators are devices surgically placed within the body to promote bone growth and fusion, often enhancing recovery after spinal surgery. Non-implantable stimulators, on the other hand, are external devices that patients can use to provide electrical stimulation or ultrasound therapy to the affected area, encouraging natural healing processes. Both types aim to improve spinal stability and reduce the risk of complications post-surgery.</p></p>
