<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Radiator Cap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vented Cap</li><li>Non-Vented Cap</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive radiator cap market is mainly divided into two types: vented caps and non-vented caps. Vented caps allow for the release of built-up pressure from the radiator, enabling the cooling system to maintain optimal pressure and prevent overheating. They play a crucial role in preventing coolant loss. Non-vented caps, on the other hand, are designed to remain sealed, maintaining pressure within the system but may not allow for pressure release. Both types ensure efficient engine cooling and system integrity.</p></p>
