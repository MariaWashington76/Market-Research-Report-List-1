<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grape Harvesters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pivotal Striker</li><li>Trunk Shaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The grape harvesters market comprises two key types: pivotal strikers and trunk shakers. Pivotal strikers utilize a mechanism that gently strikes the vines to dislodge grapes while minimizing damage to the plant. In contrast, trunk shakers apply vibration directly to the trunk, effectively shaking the fruit loose. Both methods aim to enhance efficiency and reduce labor costs during harvest, utilizing different technology to meet the demands of vineyards and optimize grape collection in the wine production process.</p></p>
