<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Aquaculture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open System</li><li>Closed System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intelligent aquaculture encompasses two primary market types: open systems and closed systems. Open systems involve natural water bodies like rivers or oceans, relying on environmental conditions and managing resources sustainably. They often have lower infrastructure costs but can face challenges like disease and pollution. Closed systems, on the other hand, use controlled environments like recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), allowing precise management of water quality and fish health. While more capital-intensive, closed systems offer higher yields and reduced environmental impact.</p></p>
